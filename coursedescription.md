### Course Description: 
This course delves into the intersection of architecture and computation, focusing on embodied design and fabrication processes. Students will explore computational tools, parametric design, and the generation of physical prototypes as integral components of architectural design. The course places a strong emphasis on hands-on projects and engagement with novel visualization techniques and augmented reality.

### Course Output:
The course is based on lectures and practical programming exercises in which students learn concepts and methods of computer-aided design, augmented reality (AR) and digital fabrication. The goal is to develop an adaptive design and fabrication methodology by creating an AR application for architects. The exercises focus on programming (C# and Python) in Unity and Grasshopper/Rhinoceros and different communication protocols (MQTT and ROS). The final group project is a phone-based AR application to assist robotic fabrication or computational design processes. It can focus on the creative or interactive part of design and fabrication. The exercises are a tool for the final project to develop the required skills. The final seven weeks will be dedicated to working on the projects in groups and will include individual introductions to advanced topics on a project-by-project basis. Each group will submit a short research paper describing the proposed methodology and project.
