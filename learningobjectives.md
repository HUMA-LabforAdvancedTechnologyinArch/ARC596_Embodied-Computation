title: Learning Objectives
---

This workshop will introduce students to XR development and Robotics using an object-aware AR app and a collaborative robot arm. The prepared sessions build upon each other towards the ability to develop an interactive architectural scenario which incorporates real-time robotic interaction: 

* Students will learn the basic concepts of human-robot collaboration
* Students will learn the basics of augmented reality
* Students will learn specific workflows for authoring AR content for a mobile phone
* Students will learn to simple communication protocols such as MQTT and ROS 
* Students will be able to think independently about novel augmented reality workflow concepts and implement them in small groups 
* Students will be able to experimentally validate their concepts in a full-scale prototype
