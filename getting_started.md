### 1. Setting up the Anaconda environment with COMPAS

Execute the commands below in Anaconda Prompt:
	
    (base) conda config --add channels conda-forge

#### Windows
    (base) conda create -n embodied_coputation compas_fab=0.22.0 compas_eve compas --yes
    (base) conda activate embodied_coputation

#### Mac
    (base) conda create -n embodied_coputation compas_fab=0.22.0 compas_eve compas --yes
    (base) conda activate embodied_coputation
    

#### Verify Installation

    (embodied_coputation) pip show compas_fab

    Name: compas-fab
    Version: 0.22.0
    Summary: Robotic fabrication package for the COMPAS Framework
    ...

#### Install on Rhino 7

    (embodied_coputation) python -m compas_rhino.install -v 7.0


### 2. Installation of Dependencies

    (embodied_coputation) conda install git

### 3. Cloning the Course Repository

Create a workspace directory:

    C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\workspace\projects

Then open Github Desktop and clone the [Embodied Computation repository](https://github.com/IntuitiveRobotics-Augmented Technologies/ARC596_Embodied-Computation) repository into your projects folder. Then install the repo within your environment (in editable mode):

**Voil√†! You can now go to VS Code, Rhino or Grasshopper to run the example files!**
