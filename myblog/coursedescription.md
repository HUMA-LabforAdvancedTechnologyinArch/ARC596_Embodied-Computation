This course delves into the intersection of architecture and computation, focusing on embodied design and fabrication processes. Students will explore computational tools, parametric design, and the generation of physical prototypes as integral components of architectural design. The course places a strong emphasis on hands-on projects and engagement with novel visualization techniques and augmented reality.
